# PDF Export & Styling Update Summary
**Date:** December 23, 2025

## 🎯 **Objective Achieved**
Successfully synchronized the PDF export with the on-screen Print Preview and significantly enhanced the readability and aesthetic of the menu by increasing font sizes and refining the layout.

## 🛠 **Key Technical Implementation**
### 1. **True-to-Preview PDF Generation**
*   **Problem:** The PDF export previously used separate HTML strings (`capturePageAtIndex`) that didn't match the React component's visual output.
*   **Solution:** Implemented a **Hidden Container Approach**.
    *   Added a hidden `div` (`#pdf-hidden-pages`) that renders **all** menu pages using the actual `PrintablePage` React component.
    *   Modified `downloadAsPDF` to use `html2canvas` to capture these pre-rendered React components.
    *   **Result:** The PDF is now a pixel-perfect capture of the live React components.

### 2. **Layout Expansion (Spacing Strategy)**
To accommodate larger fonts without content overflow or crowding, we split denser pages into multiple pages.
*   **Total Pages:** Increased from **12** to **17**.
*   **New Page Structure:**
    *   **Appetizers:** Split into *VEG APPETIZERS* (Page 2) and *NON-VEG APPETIZERS* (Page 3).
    *   **Spirits:** Split into *VODKA COLLECTION* (Page 8) and *RUMS, GINS & SPIRITS* (Page 9).
    *   **Premium:** Split into *CELEBRATION BOTTLES* (Page 12) and *WINES & LIQUEURS* (Page 13).
    *   **Refreshments:** Split into *COCKTAILS & MOCKTAILS* (Page 14) and *DESSERTS & REFRESHMENTS* (Page 15).

## 🎨 **Styling & Typography Verification**
All font sizes were increased uniformly to improve readability on A5 paper.

| Component | Final Style | Details |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Item Name** | **20px** | Sans-serif (Rajdhani), Uppercase, Bold, White |
| **Price** | **20px** | Sans-serif, Bold, Amber-400 |
| **Description** | **17px** | **Serif (Cormorant Garamond)**, Italic, Gray-300, Sentence case. Distinct from main text. |
| **Section Intro** | **17px** | Serif (Cormorant Garamond), **Semibold**, Italic, Gray-300. (e.g., "Cool, crisp...") |
| **Header** | Gradient text | "EAT • DRINK • CODE • REPEAT" (No LIVE logo) |

## 📂 **Files Modified**
*   `src/components/PrintPreview.tsx`: Core logic for layout splitting, styling updates, and PDF capture.

## 🚀 **Next Steps / Future Work**
*   **Validation:** Review the physical print of the PDF to ensure 20px isn't too large for the margins (though on-screen checks look good).
*   **Dynamic Content:** If menu items are added in the future, check pages for overflow. Since we now capture the React component, what you see in the "Print Preview" modal is exactly what will print.
